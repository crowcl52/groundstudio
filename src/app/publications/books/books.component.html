                Bernard Trainor’s newest book celebrates the wild and elemental landscapes of California, from the
                craggy coasts of Big Sur to the fertile hills of Sonoma wine country. His award-winning work combines an
                awareness of regional context with materials, collaboration, and deep connection to the land.
                Beautifully photographed and documented with full-color plans, the projects in this survey of his recent
                work include a range of scale, from compact urban gardens to expansive rural sites. Trainor’s regional,
                sustainable approach inspires wonder and respect for nature as it aims to preserve and restore it.
